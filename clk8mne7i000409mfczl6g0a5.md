## [Using parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet.html) üíâ

Parameterized queries are an essential technique in preventing SQL injection attacks. By separating user input from the query itself, these queries ensure that input values are treated as data rather than executable code. This helps protect the system from unauthorized access and malicious activities, making it a crucial practice in secure coding. Learn more about how parameterized queries can enhance your application's security. [Read more](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet.html)
