Peter Levels, the founder of Nomad List and Remote OK, and Marc Lou, the creator of various indie projects, exemplify this approach by leveraging automation, outsourcing, and a laser focus on niche markets.

### **Step-by-Step Guide to Becoming a Software Solopreneur**

#### 1\. **Ideation: Finding the Right Idea**

Your journey begins with identifying a viable software idea. Here’s how:

* **Identify Problems in Niche Markets:** Look for inefficiencies or gaps in specific niches. For example, Peter Levels focused on digital nomads, a growing but underserved community.

    * FreeCodeCamp
        
    * Codecademy
        
    * YouTube tutorials
