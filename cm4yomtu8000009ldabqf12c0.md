## Layout (layout of the CV and what are the components)

## Order (order of which section should come before which section)

### Required (required sections that should always be in every resume)

1. Experience.
    
2. Education.
    
3. Projects (side projects/bootcamp projects/college related projects).
    
4. Skills (Do not include soft skills like presentation, communication or wine tasting).
    

### Optional (they are bonus and good to have)

1. Extracuricular activities/Volunteering.
    
2. Certificates (if any) (From online courses or tests like AWS Associate or CompTIA Security+.
    
3. Languages spoken.
    

### Example

![Example of the cv of Gayle L. McDowell](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6b20fd430b457b81393d16d95790c7f7-pjlq align="center")

Let's dissect every section, but first we will address some common

# Pitfalls to avoid.

## One page

* Your CV is compacting your whole career life into 1 page, the CEO of Yahoo! cv's is 1 page, so if she can do it, you can.
    
    * The recruiters [give less than 30 seconds](https://cdn.cms-twdigitalassets.com/content/dam/careers-twitter/university/2021_Resume_101.pdf) to your resume, that's because they recieve thousands of résumés everyday, and they need to get through them all.
        
    * That means that you will need to cut some sections off, old non-impressive projects and experiences.
        

## Don't overshare, include only certain personal information.

![](https://cdn-images.zety.com/pages/resume_meme_18.png align="left")

* Your name, LinkedIn, Github, Email and phone, location (location is optional as your will be asked in the application where do you reside and can be infered from the country code of your phone, but don't put the whole address, just the city, country).
    
* Companies aren't allowed to ask about your religion, marital status, or race/ethnicity, so you shouldn't include that.
    
* Don't include your personal photo.
    
* Don't include a sumary/objective, I guarntee the recruiters don't have the time to look at them + they already know your objective; getting a job.
    
* Don't list low-priority information like hobbies, extracurriculars, or irrelevant skills like Photoshop, Premiere, Excel. Move these towards the bottom of the resume, or just leave out skills that may dilute your resume.
    
* Less is more: Focus on a few very strong points and develop those, instead of a long list of bullet point features, none of which seem very interesting for anyone to care about. If you have a big accomplishment, spend more time on your resume to talk about that.
    
    * The fact is that any bullet point could have an amazing story behind it, but you need to reveal that story.
        

## Don't include every experience

* If you have 20 years of experience and worked in 5 places, first of all; Mashallah, second, only include the most recent 3-4 experiences.
    
* Include only related technical experiences, example:
    
    * If you are applying for software engineering role, and you've worked in the past as a robotics instructor and also worked as a pizza delivery person, then the robotics instructor is more related and the pizza experinece shouldn't be included.
        

## Don't include every project

* We still remember our first Hello World code but that doesn't mean we should include it.
    
* Include the complex project.
    
    * Todo list &gt; Calculator.
        
    * Image Processing Service &gt; Todo list.
        
    * Real-time Chat Application &gt; Image Processing Service.
        
    * Custom OS &gt; Real-time Chat Application and so forth.
        
    * Network protocol which uploads and encodes files faster that Dropbox &gt; Custom OS And so on.
        

## Don't uglify nor beautify too much

* Don't use a template that has a lot of colors and profile picture.
    
* Don't have quantify your skills level
    
    * e.g. don't put you are 3/5 in C++ or 2/5 in Machine Learning (we will discuss how to prioritize your skill set.
        
* **Don't include full URLs**, hyperlink them them instead.
    
* Grammar check.
    
* Spelling check.
    
* Capitalization check.
    
* Punctuation check.
    

# Action verbs

In both Experience and Projects sections, you always start with an action verb in the past tense. The opening lines of your resume should highlight your software development expertise with active, developer-focused language. Focus on actions like developing, implementing, creating, and building:

* **Implemented** a framework for a webserver.
    
* **Built** a full-stack web app and launched to +1k.
    
* **"Developed** a REST API for batch processing.
    

Here are 20 action verbs to be used in a tech CV (Please refrain from using chatGPT for this, it uses weird words like *spearheaded*):

1. **Developed**
    
2. **Designed**
    
3. **Implemented**
    
4. **Engineered**
    
5. **Optimized**
    
6. **Built**
    
7. **Created**
    
8. **Improved**
    
9. **Architected**
    
10. **Automated**
    
11. **Integrated**
    
12. **Executed**
    
13. **Debugged**
    
14. **Deployed**
    
15. **Tested**
    
16. **Refactored**
    
17. **Collaborated**
    
18. **Customized**
    
19. **Upgraded**
    
20. **Resolved**
    

# How to write your Experience.

* Every experience should entail:
    
    * The company's name.
        
    * Your position.
        
    * Location (City, Country or Remote).
        
    * From when to when (Month Year - Month Year).
        
* Begin every bulletpoint with an action verb in the past tense.
    
* Describe the projects that you worked on, what were your contributions and your impact.
    
    * The bulletpoints should address what you did, how you did it and what was the result of that.
        
* Either you:
    
    * Dont' mention the tech stack used in the bulletpoints but dedicate the last bulletpoint for the tech stack used.
        
    * Mention the tech stack used but let it be in **Bold**.
        
    * The reason for these 2 methods is to make it easy on the recruiters to capture what skills you have industrial experience at.
        
    * Don't describe college projects or side projects, that's for the next section.
        

## Dos and Don'ts

| *Do* | *Don't* |
| --- | --- |
| Mention technical details | Mention an internal library or a project that isn't famous outside the company you've worked at |
| Discuss the impact | Discuss that you've learned tools/languages |
| Have 3-5 bulletpoints maximum per experience | Add an experience without any details/add your details as pragraphs |

# How to write your projects

![](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/48/9e/44/489e4455d08b57918ab6e6fb5c472ae3.jpg align="left")

* Writing the projects is pretty similar your experience except the projects are more well defined and done in shorter period wheras the experience could be 5 years in the same company and have worked on multiple projects.
    
* The project section is a bit tricky because you try to describe the project while describing what you did.
    
* A lot of pitfalls that people fall into is having a paragraph desrcibing the project then start with bulletpoints with the action verbs at the beginning.
    
* The work around that is to start the first bulletpoint with (Architected/Designed/Implemented/Collaberated at a software x that does y).
    
* The title of the project can be whatever you and your collegaues agreed to it, I remember me and my friend called our networks project "The new internet"
    
* You shouldn't include the place or dates of when the project started and ended.
    
* You SHOULD however hyperlink your projects with their corresponding github repo.
    
    * Make sure you upload the projects you have created/collaberated at.
        
    * Keep the Readme.md file nice and readable.
        
* Describe the problem, your solution, and the outcome.
    
* Include technologies used and their role in the project.
    
* Focus on achievements and measurable results, not just tasks.
    
* Keep it concise and tailored to the job you're applying for.

### Good and Bad examples for writing bulletpoints in Exprience/Projects.

* *❌ Bad Example | Vague and Generic Statements*  
    **"Worked on various backend projects to improve system performance."**
    
    * **Why it's bad:** Lacks detail, measurable results, and doesn't stand out.
        
* *✅ Good Example | Focus on Achievements and Impact:*  
    **"Led the migration of a monolithic application to a microservices architecture, reducing deployment time by 40% and improving system scalability to handle 3x user traffic."**
    
    * **Why it works:** Highlights specific achievements, quantified impact, and technical skills.
        
* *❌ Bad Example | Overusing Buzzwords Without Substance:*  
    **"Utilized cutting-edge technologies to deliver innovative solutions in a dynamic environment."**
    
    * **Why it's bad:** Buzzwords sound impressive but lack concrete information about what was achieved + shows you've used ChatGPT.
        
* *✅ Good Example | Showcase Collaboration*  
    **"Collaborated with cross-functional teams to design and implement a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins."**
    
    * **Why it works:** Demonstrates teamwork and direct contributions to the organization's success + your hands on expertise of devops.
        
* *❌ Bad Example | Overloading with Irrelevant Details*  
    **"Fixed printer issues and set up email accounts for team members while occasionally assisting in software development."**
    
    * **Why it's bad:** Focuses on unrelated tasks instead of showcasing relevant technical contributions.
        
* *✅ Good Example | Highlight Domain Knowledge*  
    **"Developed predictive analytics tools using Python and SQL, enabling the sales team to forecast trends with 95% accuracy."**
    
    * **Why it works:** Shows domain-specific expertise and practical applications.

# How to write Skills section

* Only include the technical skills.
    
* Divide the skills into 2 sections: Programming Languages and Tools & Frameworks.
    
* Write the technical skill even if it has been a while since you have worked with it.
    

## Do's and Don'ts

| *Do* | *Don't* |
| --- | --- |
| Include Technical skills | Don't include stuff like (Good communication, Presentation, work under preassure). |
| Be concises in the skills | Don't say Good in Python, Knowledge about Go, there is no need to quantify it. |
| Include Progamming languages, Frameworks, Tools you've used | It is not recommended to write libraries, Algorithms/DS, OOP, Operating systems, IDEs as it shows that you are just stuffing things |

**NOTE** For Product Managers, you are not expected to have technical skills regarding programming but you can write the following skills:

* Agile
    
* Competitive Analysis
    
* Business Modeling
    
* Scrum
    
* Kanban
    
* Market Mapping
    
* Cross-Functional Team Leadership
    
* Feedback Analysis
    
* Strategic Thinking
    
* User-Centric Design
    
* Technical Writing
    
* Customer Empathy
    
* User Acceptance Testing
    
* Roadmap Planning
    
* Presentation
    
* Communication
    
* Data Analysis
    
* Business Decision Making
    
* Jira
    
* Notion
    
* Confulence
    
* Figma
    
* A/B Testing
    
* SQL
    
* Miro
    

# How to write Eduction section

* **List Degrees in Reverse Chronological Order**: Start with the most recent degree or education program, including the name of the institution, degree earned, and graduation year (or expected graduation year).
    
* **Include Relevant Details**: Mention key details such as your GPA (if &gt;= 3.5), major/minor, certifications, thesis topic (if applicable), or coursework relevant to the job you're applying for.
    
* **Keep It Concise**: Avoid including irrelevant details like high school (if you have a college degree) or unrelated activities unless they are specifically relevant to the role.
    

As mentioned Include your GPA only if it is &gt;= 3.5. If your grade is in % then to convert it to GPA:

1. Divide the score by 100.
    
2. Multiply by 4.  
    Example: Say your score is 92%
    
    1. 92/100 = 0.92.
        
    2. 0.92 \* 4 = 3.68.
        

# What to do if your CV is empty

First of all breath ..

![](https://media1.tenor.com/m/1X9qxDxFcZwAAAAd/sheldon-bag.gif align="left")

It is totally normal wether you are still a student/grad/doing a career shift, no one is born with experience, and I understand the deadlock of in order to have experience you need to have experience, so here are some suggestions:

## Academia

* You ask and search for professors at your college to be their research assistant.
    
* You can write a research paper yourself (this is a high caliber experience and also, the professor could recommend you and help you in application process in the future).
    
    * **Introvert Advice**: The best you to reach professors if you are shy, is by asking TAs who is a professor with good research experience who might need a research assistant, and ask the TA to recommend you.
        
* Sometime TAs themselves need research assistants, so you can pair with them.
    
* Are you a CS newbie and not sure of which topic to start?
    
    * Read Jessica Su's answer to [What are the different research fields in computer science?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-different-research-fields-in-computer-science-What-are-the-prerequisites-to-pursue-research-in-such-fields/answer/Jessica-Su).
        
* You can also to literature review paper in a topic, check [my blog post on how to start in it](https://krietallo.hashnode.dev/quick-guide-into-literature-review-paper)

### **Sample Steps to Land a First Gig**

1. **Find a beginner-friendly project**: Search for "simple website development" or "basic Python script."
    
2. **Craft a custom proposal**:
    
    > "Hi \[Client's Name\],  
    > I saw your project for creating a simple website. I have experience building responsive websites, and I’d love to help you with this. Here’s an example of my work: \[Link\]. Let me know your requirements, and I’ll make sure to deliver on time!"
    
3. **Follow up**: If you don’t hear back in 2-3 days, politely follow up.
    

### **Key Points for Success**

* Be patient; landing the first gig takes time.
    
* Continuously learn and improve.
    
* Network with other freelancers to learn from their experiences.
    

## Projects.

Building things is how you actually learn your craft and showcase how good are you, it also what makes your CV shines among the others.

There are 4 ways to get project ideas to fill your portofolio:

### 1\. Monkey See Monkey do

Just follow a course's code or copy someone else's code --&gt; I highly advise AGAINST this as you cheat and hurt yourself and don't actually learn something.

2. ### Good all boring stuff
    

Do mundane projects like Todo list or Calculator --&gt; Put yourself in the Recruiter's shoes, why would they hire someone who wrote such a simple project. I know it isn't simple when you first did it but it is not a CV worthy project.

![](https://i.redd.it/uivii8s9xp241.jpg align="left")

3. ### Solopreneurship
    

Which is one of my favorite things, basically you build a website, mobile app or a tool that helps you solve something that you actually need.

Like for example, as you are reading these lines, you need a job, how about you build a webscrapper that auto fills 100 positions that matches your CV, or create a software that tailors the LaTeX of a 3 Pages long CV with all of your skills into 1 page CV that matches exactly every job.

How about an extention that removes NSFW pics from every website, an extension that shows nothing but cute puppy dogs videos on Youtube, etc ..

Build something that you can use, it is good for 3 reasons:

1. You will learn a lot about the language, framework, your own style of work and Software Life Cycle.
    
2. You will add a unique original thought provoking project on your resume.
    
3. How knows? If this idea took off you will be a solopreneur and begin your startup.
    

[Marc Lou](https://marclou.beehiiv.com/) is one of the pioneers in this field, I recommend watching his videos and reading his newsletter, follow him on twitter and follow the people he follows.

Also Pieter Levels is pretty good, watch his [talk](https://youtu.be/6reLWfFNer0?si=Y0DCItKyqs1TJI-9) and [podcast with Lex Freedman](https://youtu.be/oFtjKbXKqbg?si=UKOzo53nf-LZRpzV) talking about building solo startups.

For more in depth, check my article on [How to become a solopreneur](https://hashnode.com/post/cm4izxgi8000209mg7nm599tk)

4. ### [Code Crafters](https://app.codecrafters.io/catalog) (not paid promotion, I just like their idea)
    

Challenge yourself beyond implementing CRUD features. Build something that actually stimulates you. Recreate timeless software from scratch. Strengthen your fundamentals. Master your languages.

Code crafters teaches you how to build core softwares and services using the language that you are trying to learn.

You can build your own version of Git, Redis, Shell, SQLite, Grep, BitTorrent, HTTP Server, DNS Server

Every other month, they offer a challenge for you to build for free.

Even if you can't pay, you can try yourself and build your own Git and call it Splitz – Because you're always splitting and merging branches. Oops – For when you really didn't mean to commit that. BlameIt – Like Git Blame, but with extra guilt.

Ok, that's enough of jokes.

But seriously!! You will learn the internals of a tool, you will learn how to do it in your programming language and you will have an original project to put on your CV! And who know, maybe even improve on it. Just please don't put Twitter Clone on your CV, there are 10s of thousands of have that already, put it on Github, its fine, put only place unique complex challenging projects on your CV.
