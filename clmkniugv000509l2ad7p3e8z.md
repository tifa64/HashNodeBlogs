## [Quantization in Machine Learning](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/concept_guides/quantization) ü§ñ

Quantization stands as an optimization technique aimed at diminishing the computational and memory burdens of inference tasks. It accomplishes this by expressing model weights and activations using lower-precision data types, typically 8-bit integers (int8), instead of the conventional 32-bit floating-point numbers (float32).

The reduction in the bit count leads to several advantages. Firstly, it results in more efficient memory usage, making the model require less storage space. Additionally, it theoretically reduces energy consumption, and mathematical operations like matrix multiplication can be executed significantly faster using integer arithmetic. Moreover, quantization facilitates the deployment of models on embedded devices, some of which exclusively support integer data types. This broadens the applicability of machine learning models across various hardware platforms. [watch more here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFmQj7W4qlk)

## [Faiss: A Library for Efficient Similarity Search - Engineering at Meta](https://engineering.fb.com/2017/03/29/data-infrastructure/faiss-a-library-for-efficient-similarity-search/) üîé

Conventional databases are typically structured around tables that store symbolic information. To illustrate, consider an image collection represented as a table, where each row corresponds to a distinct indexed photo. These rows contain data such as image identifiers and descriptive text. Furthermore, rows can establish connections with entries from other tables, for instance, associating an image containing individuals with a table of corresponding names.

In contrast, AI tools, like text embeddings (e.g., word2vec) or descriptors generated by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) through deep learning, produce high-dimensional vectors. These vector representations offer superior power and flexibility compared to fixed symbolic representations, as elaborated upon in this article. However, traditional databases designed for SQL queries are ill-suited for handling these novel representations.

Two primary challenges arise. Firstly, the continuous influx of new multimedia items results in billions of vectors, overwhelming the database infrastructure. Secondly, and of greater significance, searching for similar entries translates into identifying akin high-dimensional vectors, a task that proves inefficient, if not practically unattainable, using standard query languages.

The question emerges: how can a vector-based representation be effectively integrated into the database paradigm?

## [Clustered vs Non-Clustered Index in SQL Server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITcOiLSfVJQ)üóÑÔ∏è

In SQL Server, the choice between clustered and non-clustered indexes plays a pivotal role in database optimization. A clustered index determines the physical order of data rows in a table, essentially reorganizing the table itself. This makes it ideal for tables frequently queried using range-based or exact-match searches. However, there can be only one clustered index per table.

On the other hand, non-clustered indexes create a separate structure, containing a subset of table columns. Multiple non-clustered indexes can be created for a single table, facilitating various search patterns. They are useful for optimizing queries that involve sorting, filtering, or joining data.

The key to efficient SQL Server performance lies in understanding when to use each index type, as their selection significantly impacts query execution and overall database efficiency.
