## [What is the castle-and-moat network security model?](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/castle-and-moat-network-security/) üè∞

The castle-and-moat model is a simple analogy used to explain network security. It involves building multiple layers of security around important assets, represented by the castle, while using firewalls, anti-virus software and other protective measures as moats to keep attackers away. The more moats there are, the harder it becomes for attackers to reach the castle. This model emphasizes having defense in depth with multiple layers of security controls.

## [What is Explainable AI (XAI)](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-explainable-ai-xai-afc56938d513) ü§ñ

Explainable AI refers to techniques that enable AI systems to provide explanations for their decisions, predictions or other outputs. The goal of XAI is to make AI algorithms more transparent, interpretable and trustworthy. It allows humans to understand, appropriately trust, and effectively manage the emerging generation of artificially intelligent partners.
