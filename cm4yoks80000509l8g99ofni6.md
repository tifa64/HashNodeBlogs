# How to ask for a referal

1. People are drown towards people from the same region/country/city/university .. you can filter by universities in your country and send them connection request.
    
    1. They know how it feels like to be a student at the same city/country/university and they are more likely to refer you.

2. Find a job that you are interested at in the company where that person works at.
    
3. do NOT apply.
    
4. Make sure your LinkedIn is nice and updated and have listed your skills, experiences, education, projects as the person will check your LinkedIn.
    
5. Message the person with the following text:
    

> Hello x,
> 
> I hope this message finds you well.
> 
> My name is y, I’m a student/software engineer and I wish is to work at (name of the company).
> 
> I’ve seen this position (url of the position) and I believe it suits me skills and I’m fit for the role. I want to ask you if you could refer me to it if you deem me worthy of it.
> 
> I’m attaching my resume to this message.
> 
> P.s. It is totally understandable if you don’t see me fit to the role, I thank you anyway for taking time to read my message and I wish you a nice rest of day :))
> 
> Best regards,
> 
> y

6. You don’t have to copy exactly the words but basically make sure that they are not obligated, people tend to do a task if they feel they are not forced to do it.
    

# How to message recruiters

1. Repeat the same steps to filter out people who work at the company but don’t include location nor school.
    
2. Change to title to Talent as sometimes the recruiter’s name is Talent sourcer or Recruiter
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1734815517525/37fe7c42-3adf-4221-bfe6-59ba58626f01.png align="center")
    
    Or
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1734815534273/50bd177e-e434-48cf-9dcf-3cfdf084d218.png align="center")
    
3. Also send connections to the recruiters.
    
4. Send the following message
    

> Hello x,
> 
> My name is y, I’m a student/software engineer and I wish is to work at (name of the company).
> 
> I have just applied to this role (url of the role) and I’m looking forward to hearing from your side and be part of the team :))
> 
> Have a lovely day,
> 
> y

Remember, LinkedIn is a powerful tool, networking is needed and you need recruiters on your side.

Also remeber, if you messaged 50 people and 49 of them ignored you, you need only 1 to reply with yes I will refer you :))
