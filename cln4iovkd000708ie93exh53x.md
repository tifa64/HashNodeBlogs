## [8 Deployment Strategies Explained and Compared](https://www.apwide.com/8-deployment-strategies-explained-and-compared/)ðŸš¢

Deployment strategies are techniques used by DevOps teams to successfully launch new versions of software. There are several types:

* Blue/Green deployment runs new and old versions concurrently. It allows quick updates but is costly.
    
* Canary deployment gradually shifts traffic to the new version. It enables performance monitoring and faster rollback but is slow.
    
* Recreate deployment shuts down the old version completely. It is cheaper but causes downtime.
    
* Ramped deployment replaces instances of the old version one by one. It provides zero downtime but has a long rollback duration.
    
* Shadow deployment tests the new version without exposing it to users. It is complex and expensive.
    
* A/B testing deployment exposes the new version to a subset of users based on parameters. It measures effectiveness but is complex to set up.
    

No single strategy is best. DevOps teams must choose based on their needs, goals, and ability to tolerate downtime. Tools can help automate and streamline the deployment process. [Read more](https://www.apwide.com/8-deployment-strategies-explained-and-compared/)

## [Node.js vs. Deno vs. Bun: JavaScript runtime comparison](https://snyk.io/blog/javascript-runtime-compare-node-deno-bun/)ðŸ¥–

Node.js has been the dominant JavaScript runtime for years, but Deno and Bun aim to improve performance, security and developer experience.

Node.js is mature with a huge ecosystem but can be slow and insecure. Deno focuses on security, modern features and TypeScript support. Bun aims for raw speed and bundles features like testing and bundling.

Bun is ~2.5x faster than Node.js and Deno in benchmarks, handling ~80k requests per second compared to ~30k for Deno and ~15k for Node.js. However, Bun is still in beta with little community support.

Deno and Bun both use modern web APIs and single executable files. Deno requires permissions for actions while Bun uses a fast engine.

Node.js has the largest community and ecosystem but suffers from performance issues. Deno improves security and web compatibility while Bun significantly outperforms both but lacks stability being a young project.

In summary, Node.js is the safest choice due to maturity while Deno offers modern features and Bun extreme performance though immature. The choice depends on priorities like speed, security and stability. [Read more](https://snyk.io/blog/javascript-runtime-compare-node-deno-bun/)

## [  
The Lean Startup Summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSaIOCHbuYw) ðŸ’¡

* The goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing to build â€“ that customers want and will pay for - as quickly as possible.
    
* To confirm or reject your hypothesis, experiments must be run to gain validated learning about potential customers. An MVP usually forms the basis of such experiments.
    
* Three popular types of MVPs are: Video, concierge (cut) and the wizard of Oz
    
* Every startup should focus on an engine of growth â€“ either the sticky, the viral or the paid one
    
* Successful entrepreneurship is about perseverance and flexibility at the same time. Pivoting an idea does not equal failure, in fact, almost every successful startup has done a major change to its strategy at some point.
